# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to launch this space where I'll be sharing my thoughts, learnings, and experiences in software development.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Front-End Development** - React, Svelte, and modern web technologies
- **Software Engineering** - Best practices, patterns, and architecture
- **Learning Journey** - Insights from my path in tech
- **Projects** - Deep dives into my personal projects

## Built with Modern Tech

This blog is built using:

```typescript
const stack = {
  framework: 'Astro 5',
  ui: 'Svelte 5',
  styling: 'Tailwind CSS v4',
  content: 'MDX',
  deployment: 'Vercel'
};
```

Stay tuned for more content!
